# Markov-Chain-Movie-Carlo
Script originally written as project for third year data engineering topics course. 
Program uses Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape movie names from IMDB using a markov chain like algorithm. 
The user can select a starting movie and then the script iteratively samples an actor from the movie, and then a movie from that actors filmography.
This ends when you feel like it.

The data is outputted in a file called imdb.csv
